# WeatherApp
A node shell-run app that implements web-scraping with axios' promise chaining functionality on two APIs (Google Maps API and forecast.io API) to provide information about the temperature, apparent temperature, and a general suggestion on the type of clothing to wear based on the weather. 

# Example:
${$node app-weather.js -a "iceland"
Loading weather info
Iceland 
 It's currently 34.49. It feels like 27.19
 Brace yourself for a rainy day
 Wear a jacket duuuude!}
